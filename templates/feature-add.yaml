risks:
  - id: r1
    risk: Scope creep during implementation
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Strict scope definition, defer enhancements to backlog
    status: identified
  
  - id: r2
    risk: Breaking existing functionality
    impact: high
    mitigation: Comprehensive test suite, integration tests
    status: identified
