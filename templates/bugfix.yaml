id: bugfix
name: Fix Bug
goal: Identify, fix, and verify a bug resolution
steps:
  - id: s1
    name: Reproduce the issue
    description: Confirm the bug and understand its conditions
    inputs:
      - bug report
      - error logs
    outputs:
      - reproduction steps
      - minimal test case
    checks:
      - bug reproducible
      - conditions documented
    status: pending
  
  - id: s2
    name: Identify root cause
    description: Debug and find the source of the issue
    inputs:
      - reproduction steps
      - codebase
    outputs:
      - root cause analysis
      - affected components
    checks:
      - cause verified
      - related issues checked
    status: pending
  
  - id: s3
    name: Implement fix
    description: Apply the fix for the identified issue
    inputs:
      - root cause analysis
    outputs:
      - fix implementation
      - fix explanation
    checks:
      - fix is minimal
      - no side effects
    status: pending
  
  - id: s4
    name: Add regression test
    description: Create test to prevent bug recurrence
    inputs:
      - reproduction steps
      - fix implementation
    outputs:
      - regression test
    checks:
      - test fails before fix
      - test passes after fix
    status: pending
  
  - id: s5
    name: Verify fix
    description: Confirm the bug is resolved
    inputs:
      - fix implementation
      - original bug report
    outputs:
      - verification results
    checks:
      - original case fixed
      - edge cases tested
    status: pending

risks:
  - id: r1
    risk: Fix introduces new bugs
    impact: high
    mitigation: Comprehensive testing, code review
    status: identified
  
  - id: r2
    risk: Incomplete fix (symptom vs root cause)
    impact: medium
    mitigation: Deep analysis, verify with multiple test cases
    status: identified
